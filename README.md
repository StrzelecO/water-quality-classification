# 💧 Binary Classification for Water Quality Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to evaluate the potability of water samples using various binary classification methods. The goal is to compare the performance of different machine learning models and assess their effectiveness in predicting whether a given water sample is safe for consumption.

## Research Objective
The objective of this study is to analyze water quality based on its physicochemical parameters and classify it as potable or non-potable using machine learning techniques. The dataset is divided into a training set and a test set, where one part is used to train the models and the other to evaluate their accuracy.

## Methods Used
This project utilizes four classification models along with one hybrid model, which combines two classifiers for enhanced accuracy:

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Random Forest (RF)**
- **Naïve Bayes (NB)**
- **Hybrid Model** (Combination of Two Models)

##  Key Features Analyzed
The dataset includes **10 key physicochemical features** used to determine water quality:

### Input Features:
- **pH Level** – Measures acidity or alkalinity (ideal: 6.5 - 8.5).
- **Hardness** – Indicates dissolved minerals like calcium and magnesium.
- **Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)** – Reflects mineral content in mg/L.
- **Chloramines** – Used for disinfection, safe levels ≤ 4 mg/L.
- **Sulfates** – Naturally occurring compounds, ideal range: 3 - 30 mg/L.
- **Conductivity** – Measures water’s ability to conduct electricity (ideal ≤ 400 μS/cm).
- **Total Organic Carbon (TOC)** – Indicates organic matter content (< 2 mg/L for drinking water).
- **Trihalomethanes (THM)** – Byproducts of chlorine treatment, safe level ≤ 80 ppm.
- **Turbidity** – Measures clarity of water, ideal ≤ 5 NTU.

### Target Feature:
- **Potability** – `1` (safe to drink) / `0` (not safe to drink).

##  Expected Outcomes
- Identify the most accurate model for predicting water potability.
- Understand the impact of different water quality parameters on classification.
- Provide insights for water quality monitoring and public health safety.
